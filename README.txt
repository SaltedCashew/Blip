Programming in Blip

 Blip is a fictitious programming language with functions, loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic. This program is designed for reading and interpreting a ficitious programming language called Blip. Examples of blip programming language can be found on the github page (link below). 

 Some language features include: scoped variables; output statements; arithmentic; comparison and unary operators; parameter scoping, arguments and return statements.

The interpreter, written in C++, reads the blip file, parses, and stores each instruction. Binary search trees and expression trees are used to process instructions, loops, and arithmetic expressions. Both recursive and iterative instructions are handled.
